# Shimmer Component

## Usa below commands to install and run the code
* `npm install` to install dependencies on package.json
* `npm start` to run the project on localhost:8080.
Please open `localhost:8080` in your browser


The Shimmer component takes html element in the form of string and outputs an html element with shimmer effect

The logic is in `src/index.js` file and css is in `src/index.css`
Here I have added two independent components with their styles as an example

Future scope:

1. It can provide configuration to support the list of the elements as arrray of values for which the shimmer should be added - css selectors
2. It can support input with the properties like colour, speed etc., of the animation
